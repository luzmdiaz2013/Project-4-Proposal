## Initial thoughts on game structure

I expect to re-create my PerScholas final project in ruby on rails 

- Using Ruby on rails, I love the ease, and the logic/syntax is clearer for me but I have had significantly less experience with this .
- Using erb for CRUD

I would like the end result to be that a Dr. Hernandez can use this site professionally and personally and that it helps attract more traffic for her company.
